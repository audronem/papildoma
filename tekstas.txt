For centuries, Vilnius https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnius as a capital city was an art centre of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and has attracted artists from all across Europe.
The oldest works of art which remained from the early Gothic period https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_art (14th century) are paintings dedicated to churches and liturgy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liturgy (e.g. frescoes in the Crypts of Vilnius Cathedral, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnius_Cathedral decorated hymns books).
Walls paintings from the 16th centuries were also discovered in Vilnius (e.g. painting of the Church of St. Francis and St. Bernard vaults or in the Church of Saint Nicholas).
Gothic wooden, mostly polychrome sculptures were used to decorate the altars of the churches of Vilnius.
Some Gothic seals from the 14–15th centuries remained till the nowadays (Kęstutis, Vytautas the Great, Sigismund II Augustus).
